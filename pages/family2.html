  <header><h1>The Family</h1>
        <p> Albert's family belonged to a relatively affluent peasant class which Stalin vowed to 'remove' in its
            entirety because they represented a possible obstacle to his plans. To do so he orchestrated a 
            <a href="https://alphahistory.com/russianrevolution/cheka/#Summary">campaign of terror</a> across Russia.

          <h2>Aliide Noole (Albert's mother)</h2>
          <p>Albert's mother, Aliide, was from a relatively comfortable home in Markuse, near Gatchina. Her parents, Maarja 
              and Madis Noole, were of Estonian stock and part of a large Finnic community. 
            </p>
            <p> Whilst single Aliide had spent much time in Narva, Estonia living with relatives, where she received formal 
                training to become a seamstress. She visited relatives and made lasting friends. She found life in Estonia pleasant relaying her positive experience to her children in the form of stories. 
                Her fond recollections make an impact on her children and she made it clear that she would like to return to her mother country.</p>

          <h2>Vassili Georgijev</h2>
         
        
        <p> Albert's father in uniform (c.1916). </p>
        <p>He would have seen action on the Eastern Front against Germany in World War One and in 1917 experienced
            the changes that came with the revolution. 
        <p>
          Generally, it is known that he was adopted by a Finnish lady who owned a fine house in Niiskovitsa village, 
            Ingria (now Staryye Nizkovitsy). There is no information, though, regarding the orphanage in which he was placed or 
            how he came by a Bulgarian surname. 
         </p> <p>
          Incidentally, DNA test results from Albert's children reveal a strong Russian link but no evidence of a Balkan link. </p>

          <h2>Vassili & Aliide </h2>
   
          <p>As was customary Aliide left her parents' went to live with her husband in Niskovitsa village. On leaving the army Vassili took up farming. </p>
          <p>  Albert recalled how hard his father worked on the farm tending to animals, tilling the land and getting produce to market. Over time Vassili added more land but it never compared to the farm in Markuse. </p>

          <p> Salme remembers her mother being 'friendly and popular' in the village of Niiskovitsa. The home received regular visitors, including doctors, teachers and people from the Lutheran church which she attended regularly. </p>
          <p>
            As a seamstress she was able to clothe her family and provide a service to the community. Albert could remember hearing the reassuring rhythm of the sewing machine and the image of his mother carefully working fabric. Aliide taught her children sewing skills. Albert's darning was excellent.

          <h2>Aliide and children (c.1928)</h2>
          <p>In this family photograph the children look nourished and well clothed although Aliide appears strained and perhaps anxious. Vassili is noticeably absent given that family photographs were a planned event.  </p>

            <p>From left to right the children are: Ludmilla, Rosalie, Salme, Niina and Albert (blue stripes). <br><p>Two other children had died: Rudolf after a kitchen accident and Maria at the age of two. Another two children are yet to be born namely, Leontina (or Lonni) and Maria (aka Manni).</p>

          <h2>Grand-parents Madis and Maarja </h2>
          <p>Maarja and Madis married in 1884 and had five children: Alexandr, Amalie, Emilie, Anna, and Aliide. </p>
          <p>All helped with the farm but Aleksandr went on to be involved in working alongside his father Madis in building it up. Once family needs were met surplus dairy produce as well as vegetables and hay were carted to market at Gatchina. Larger loads of hay were taken to Leningrad for the cart drivers.  </p>
            <p>
           They were considered wealthy farmers. They owned large stretches of land including a forest. The photograph was taken before any direct threats of deportation.   </p>
            <p>
  Aliide's parents Madis and Maarja are front left with young Albert standing behind them and in front of his mother.
            </p>
            <p>Aleksandr's wife Maria and two children are present. </p>

          <h2>Uncle Aleksandr </h2>
          <p>Madis' first born, Aleksandr, is front right with legs crossed. He seems well dressed and relaxed, even though he knew that troubling times lay ahead. Aleksandr is Aliide's brother and Albert's uncle. </p>

          <p>
 Whereas Madis and Maarja were originally from Estonia their children were born in Ingria. Aleksandr's sisters, Amalie, Emilie, Aliide and Anna, married and moved away but he shared the family's large farm house in Markuse with his wife Maria and children. 
          </p>        
            
          <p>
 Maria, nee Seiler, was the daughter of a wealthy factory owner in Pärnu, Estonia and would have been used to a fine standard of living. Aleksandr actually met her in a St Petersburg restaurant and may have had some problems in settling into life in Markuse. Madis got along well with his daughter-in-law, but Maarja apparently did not. Perhaps Maria was unhappy having moved to Ingria from Pärnu.
