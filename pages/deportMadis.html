      <p>Aliide's parents Madis and Maarja and brother Aleksandr were targeted because they were successful farmers and as such damned as <span id="span1">'enemies of the people'.</span> 
        All three were ordered to be deported and their property forfeited to the state.

      <h3>Deportation </h3>
         <p> When agents came to the Markuse farm to take Madis, Maarja and Aleks to Gatchina station for the journey to Siberia they failed to find them. Consequently, they missed the train. They had been 'working' in the forest at the time! </p>
        
        <p>  Local officers eventually carried out the deportation order sending the family to the town of Volosovo, Ingria. Their property became state property. The three were ordered to stay in the area and warned not to travel. </p>
        <p>However, Volosovo was in the same region of Ingria and undaunted they made secret visits to family, including the Georgijevs. </p>        
       <p>Salme, a child at the time, was able to recall her grandparents having to leave behind two cats, Ruti and Ints, as well as a dog, Pontu.</p>
