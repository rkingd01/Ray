<p>The photograph is dated about 1931 set in the village of Niitskovitsa, the home village of Vassili. Alide moved out from her father's farm in Markuse, near Leningrad. </p>
<p>Albert Georgiev was born in 1924 in Niitsforgika, Ingria Russia and died in cardiff UK at 74. He was the only boy who survived childhood in a family of nine. His father farmed, his mother sewed. In the week Albert attended school with sister (BBBB). On Sundays all attended church and entertained visitors at home. A life with regularity and security. Until Stalin's reforms hit the family. The farm was confiscated, all land lost, all animals taken. The home had to be shared with a Collectives shop until the family moved to a home vacated by Alide's parents.
