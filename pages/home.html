        <div class="box1">  This image (c.1932) is set in Niitskovitsa, Ingria, the home village of Vassili (Albert's father). The general area was settled by Finnish and Estonian peoples.  Alide looks tense in the picture and with good reason: the social class to which she belongs has been directly targeted by Stalin's 
        <a href="https://study.com/learn/lesson/stalins-five-year-plan-collectivization-industrialization.html">drive to get rid of the middle classes.</a>
        <p>  Up to this point the family lived off their land occasionally selling any surplus locally whilst Alide added to the family's income by working fabric.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box2">
            On week days Albert remembered boarding at the Finnish school with his sister Salme. <p>  Then on Sundays he was encouraged to go to church with his mother Alide and sisters. Alide invited attendees to her home. </p>
       
          <p> Life was not easy but was stable and secure. Stalin's reforms not only threatened to       jeopardise this way of life but to actively punish all those in this social class. </p>
