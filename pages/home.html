<h1>1930s: Ingria (Niitskovitsa)</h1>

        <div class="box1">  This image is set in Niitskovitsa, Ingria, the home village of Vassili (Albert's father Vassili). The general area was settled by Finnish and Estonian peoples.  Alide looks tense in the picture and with good reason: the social class to which she belongs has been directly targeted by Stalin's
            <a href="https://study.com/learn/lesson/stalins-five-year-plan-collectivization-industrialization.html">Five Year Plan.</a>
            Up to this point the family lived off their land occasionally selling any surplus locally whilst Alide added to the family's income by working fabric.  On week days Albert remembered walking miles to school with his sister Salme. Then on Sundays he was expected to go to church with his mother Alide and sisters. Alide invited attendees to her home. Life was not easy but was stable and secure. </div>

            <div class="box2"> Stalin's reforms not only threatened to jeopardise this way of life but to actively punish all those in this social class.The reforms were preceded by propaganda citing landowners, successful farmers, non-Russians and church-goers as 'enemies of the people'. The Georgijev farm was confiscated, all land lost, all animals taken, except <a href="../img/VasCowCoL.jpg">a single cow .</a>  
                    <> Vassili was put to work as a labourer on what was his own farm. To add to his humiliation he was paid in grain that he had to carry to a local mill to be ground to flour. The indignity experienced and the taunts received were hard to bare for Vassili. Vodka helped to ease his pain.
                    When the home had to be shared with a Collectives shop, a main product of which was vodka, the family's safety was jeopardised. The incursion of drunken men into the private living area must have been frightening. The older girls were particularly at risk. Eventually the family gained permission to move to the empty home of her parents and brother <a href="../pages/madis.html"> who had been evicted.</a>
