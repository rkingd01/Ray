    <p>The image is set in Niitskovitsa, Ingria, the home village of Vassili (Albert's father). The general area was settled by Finnish and Estonian peoples.  </p>

    <p> Alide looks tense in the picture and with good reason. The family lived off their own land that Vassili worked selling any surplus. Alide added to the family's income by working fabric.     </p>
    <p>   On week days Albert remembered walking miles to school with his sister Salme. Then on Sundays he was expected to go to church with his mother Alide and sisters. Alide invited visitors to their home. Life was not easy but was stable and secure.  </p>
       <p>  Stalin's reforms not only threatened to jeopardise this way of life but to actively punish all those in this social class. </p> 
       
 
    <p>The reforms were preceded by propaganda citing all landowners, successful farmers, non-Russians and church-goers as enemies of the people who should be culled. </p>
    <p>The farm was confiscated, all land lost, all animals taken, except a single cow. Vassili was put to work as a labourer on what was his own farm. To add to his humiliation he was paid in raw grain that he had to carry to a local mill to be ground to flour. The indignity experienced and the taunts received were hard to bear for Vassili. To ease his pain, he took to drink.</p> 
    <p>
    When the home had to be shared with a Collectives shop, whose main product was vodka, the family's safety was jeopardised with the incursion of drunken men stumbling into the living room. The older girls were particularly at risk. After unrelenting pressure from Alide the family gained permission to move to the home vacated by Alide's parents.
