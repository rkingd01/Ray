                <p>Favoured perhaps by Vassili's sound army service record the Georgijev family were not deported and were allowed to stay in their home.   </p>
                
                <p>Much to their dismay, however, their house was soon 're-appropriated' in order to facilitate a local 'collective shop'. 
               </p>
              
             <p>
                 The shop sold farm produce and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/34/6/824/192703"> vodka. </a> Family privacy was greatly compromised: strangers were able to wander through the Georgijev home leaving Aliide and daughters vulnerable. This was an extremely difficult time for the whole family. With Vassili taking to drink to ease his despair Aliide remained resolute.

           <h3 id="markuse"> Markuse as Home</h3>

            <p>
                The situation in the family home became untenable and driven by Aliide and the need to protect the children Vassili sought permission to move to the empty home of Aliide's 'deported' parents in Markuse.
                With permission granted (c.1932) they made the move to Aliide's childhood home. However happy and secure she had been in the past nothing could have prepared her for the experience of entering her parents' deserted and damaged house. Isolated in Markuse the family made some recovery. Leontina and Maria (Manni) were born in the five years spent in Markuse. Albert now had six sisters.

            <p>
                Also in 1938 it was decreed that all housing had to be in government approved settlements  
                <a href="https://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/kolkhoz/"> (Kolkhoz)</a>. The home in Markuse was deemed to be in an area that was not officially sanctioned for settlement. Local bureaucrats ruled that the property be destroyed and the family evicted. Aliide pleaded that her family of nine would be homeless with winter approaching.  </p>
                <p>The home was made uninhabitable to prevent re-occupation. A barn had been left standing and here the family lived sleeping on straw for three weeks until a Finnish woman stepped forward and offered to share her small home. This act of kindness may have saved lives.</p>

            <p>
                In Spring 1941 the the family were directed to accommodation in Vitino, a large village north of
                Niiskovista located near the main road from Narva (Estonia) to Leningrad. The accommodation allocated was
                a single room and a kitchen in a house occupied by an old lady. 
                This was an unsettled area given the German offensive in the west.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1941 Albert and his father Vassili found employment at the airfield near Vitino. This was an established centre of aviation and engine technology.</p>
            <p> In the Autumn the airfield and engineering centre
                    was targeted by Luftwaffe bombers. The air-field and the town suffered extensive bomb damage.

                    <p>  For safety families left their homes to hide in the forest. Vassili guided the family deep into the forest to a
                    high railway embankment against which they set up camp. Pitching canvas against the incline. After a stay of two weeks
                    they were discovered by Russian politruks and ordered to leave immediately. Russian patrols were charged with destroying anything that could used by the oncoming German army. The'scorched earth' left long trails of thick black smoke across the area.

                <h3 id="leningrad_rd">'Don't go to Leningrad!'</h3>
                <p> After the encounter with Russian troops Vassili decided to take the road east toward Leningrad. On route they were stopped by an old army acquaintance of Vassili who warned him not to proceed.
                He had grim news of a city under seige and people starving. 
                At this point it seems that Aliide persuaded Vassili to go west toward Narva and leave Russia. Being Russian and ex-army this venture was potentially dangerous for Vassili.
