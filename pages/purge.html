    <h1>Stalin's Purges</h1>



    <h2 id="state-propaganda" >State Propaganda</h2>

  
    <p class="para"> The earliest of Stalin's purges (1929-32) was preceded by an intense programme of propaganda inciting hatred and fueling paranoia toward land-owning farmers, non-Russians and church-goers as 'enemies of the people' or Kulaks. 
    Stalin openly announced the "liquidation of the kulaks as a class" on 27 December 1929.
     Anti-Kulak posters became commonplace with a strong visual impact in order to reach the illiterate.

        <h2 id="evictions">Evictions</h2>
        <p class="para">The disposession of Kulaks was a key principle. This included all property, land, and stock. Families were coldly evicted and possibly transported to the east. Families with very young children faced a huge dilemma.

        <h2 id="orphans">Orphans</h2>
        <p class="para"> The image dates to 1938 at the time of the Great Purge when millions were affected by Stalin's directives. With the 'removal' of so many parents thousands of children were left orphaned. This may well have horrified Aliide and Vassili and driven them to action.
