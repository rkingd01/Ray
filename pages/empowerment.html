        <p>  In keeping with Stalinist ideology the state  
          <a href="https://flashbak.com/the-great-break-the-russian-peasant-becomes-the-collective-farmer-1920-1931-363372/">
          encouraged peasants   </a> through the promise of empowerment.

          Stalin succeeded in 'removing' the affluent class by giving unlimited powers to the Cheka (NKVD) terror network. An unrelenting stream of state-controlled propaganda targeted the peasant class constantly reminding them how affluent class had prospered while they starved.

     <p>
      Stalin reasoned that this class was responsible for the failure of the cooperatives and therefore culpable for the shortages that followed. <br>  There were of course other factors at play:

    <br>
    <ul class="list1">
          <li>
            Private farmers had been less than supportive of the Oktober Revolution and it was feared that any counter-revolution would come from this source. 
          </li>

            In Ingria many successful farmers and their families were of a Finnic origin and given the undisguised policy of ethnic cleansing were prime targets. 
            
          </li>
          <li>
            The land seized from Finnic farmers greatly expanded collective farms.

              Powerful imagery </a>
            demonised the landowners whilst amplifying the demise of the peasant class. 
            Many of these landowners were executed and many more were deported.

          </li>
          <li>
            Despite the atrocities committed the Cheka secret police were untouchable.  Indeed, the horrific details of their savagery was part of their modus operandi. 
          </li>

    </ul>
