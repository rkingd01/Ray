    <hr></br>
    <p>
        In 1932, after the shock of her parents and brother receiving deportation orders Albert's parents were told that they too had been identified as 'affluent peasants' and that they would be punished. Their home, their land and their animals were confiscated. However, the family of seven was allowed to remain in the house.  </p>

        <h3>The Humiliation of Vassili</h3>
   
        
        <p>Given Vassili's military record some allowance had been  expected in keeping with the 'Russian way'. None was given, indeed, being given a single cow was further public humiliation. </p>

    <p> The humbling of Vassili continued when put to work as a labourer on what had been his own farm. Once a proud man farming his own land, caring for his own animals, he was reduced to working long hours on the same land and with the same animals for payment not in money but in grain. This grain had to be taken to the cooperative mill where he would be made to wait for the flour produced. Here as in other public places he was vulnerable to the taunts of newly elevated peasant workers. Beyond losing all that he owned his fall in status had left him a target for  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekulakization"> abuse. </a>  However, he still had friends, both  Finnic and Russian, who stood by him, albeit at a safe distance. Not all Russians were blinded by Stalinist rhetoric. </p>

   <h3>The Industry of Aliide  </h3>
</br>
    <p>Meanwhile, Aliide's clandestine business of sewing and tailoring continued. She would have received some form of payment, preferably not in money but food. The sewing machine itself was vital to the family's well-being so when some intruding neighbours found it and tried to remove it Aliide and her children fought to keep it tenaciously.  After a tense stand-off the intruders left without the sewing machine. Anti-Kulak' propaganda was so strong that certain neighbours could no longer be trusted. </p>
   
<p class="bottom-gap3">   The 'individual enterprise' of Aliide's was highly illicit but, undaunted, 
        Aliide accepted the risk. Throughout the day she continued to repair and alter all sorts of fabric. </p>
