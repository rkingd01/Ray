                <p>Aliide's parents were labelled as 'Kulaks' and sentenced to be deported but the Georgijev family were not: Vassili employed no one and was Russian born.  </p>
                
                <p>However, the family home was soon 're-appropriated' in order to facilitate a local 'collective shop' and this caused huge problems.

             <p>
                 The collective shop sold farm produce and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/34/6/824/192703"> vodka. </a> Family privacy was greatly compromised: drunken strangers were able to wander through the Georgijev home leaving Aliide and daughters vulnerable. At this time a depressed Vassili found solace in drink to ease despair. In short, life became extremely difficult for Aliide.

           <h3 id="markuse"> A New Home</h3>

            <p>
                The situation in the family home must have become untenable as local agents granted them permission to move to the empty home of Aliide's parents in Markuse.
                With permission granted (c.1932/33) they made the move to Aliide's childhood home. Isolated in Markuse the family made some recovery. Leontina and Maria (Manni) were born in the five years spent in Markuse. Albert now had six sisters.

            <p>
                In 1938 the State decreed that all housing had to be in government approved settlements  
                <a href="https://russiapedia.rt.com/of-russian-origin/kolkhoz/"> (Kolkhoz)</a>. The home in Markuse was deemed to be in an area that was not officially sanctioned for settlement. Local bureaucrats ruled that the property be destroyed. Despite Alide's pleas on behalf of her nine children and the approach of Winter the family were evicted and the house flattened.   </p>
                <p>A barn had been left standing and here the family lived sleeping on straw for three weeks until a Finnish woman stepped forward and offered to share her small home. This act of kindness may have saved lives.</p>

            <p>
                In Spring 1941 the authorities sent the family directed to Vitino, a large village north of Niiskovista located near the main road from Narva (Estonia) to Leningrad. The accommodation allocated was
                a single room and a kitchen in a house occupied by an old lady. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Labour was needed in an air base near Vitino, a centre of aviation and engine technology. Vassili, Albert and some of the sisters found worked at the base. However, the airfield and engineering centre was soon targeted by Luftwaffe bombers.

                    <p>  For safety families left their homes to hide in the forest. Vassili guided his family deep into the forest to a
                    high railway embankment against which they set up camp pitching canvas against the incline. After a stay of two weeks
                    they were discovered by Russian politruks and ordered to leave immediately. Russian patrols were charged with destroying anything that could used by the oncoming German army.
