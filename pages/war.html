            Throughout Ingria many families with a Baltic heritage were made homeless but were unable to return to these neighbouring countries as Russia occupied them. However, the German army invaded the Baltic states in the Summer of 1941 and chased the Russian army out of Narva on August 17, 1941. This provided a window of opportunity for families trying to get out of Russia.
