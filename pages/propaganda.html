    <h1>Stalin's Purge</h1>



    <h2 id="state-propaganda">State Propaganda</h2>

  
        <p class="box2"> The reforms were preceded by propaganda citing landowners, successful farmers, non-Russians and church-goers as 'enemies of the people'. The Georgijev farm was confiscated, all land lost, all animals taken, except <a href="../img/VasCowCoL.jpg">a single cow .</a>  
            Vassili was put to work as a labourer on what was his own farm. To add to his humiliation he was paid in grain that he had to carry to a local mill to be ground to flour. The indignity experienced and the taunts received were hard to bare for Vassili. Vodka helped to ease his pain.
            When the home had to be shared with a Collectives shop, a main product of which was vodka, the family's safety was jeopardised. The incursion of drunken men into the private living area must have been frightening. The older girls were particularly at risk. Eventually the family gained permission to move to the empty home of her parents and brother <a href="../pages/madis.html"> who had been evicted.</a>
