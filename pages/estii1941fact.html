        <h1>German Occupation of Estonia</h1>


        <p> Before the German army entered Estonia Soviet occupiers had deported about 
            <a href="https://estonianworld.com/life/estonia-remembers-the-soviet-deportations/">10,000 Estonians</a>
            to Siberia and Kazakstan and they did so giving no warning. Those deported included intellectuals and high ranking ministers including the president. Another 2,200 Estonians were executed. Estonian society was shocked to its roots. 
            </p><p><br>
            Deportations only ceased when the German army advanced into the Baltic countries in  <a href="http://www.estonica.org/en/History/1939-1945_Estonia_and_World_War_II/German_invasion_of_Estonia_in_1941/">July 1941.</a>
            Unsurprisingly, Estonian nationals welcomed this intervention. In contrast to the Russian authoritarian approach the German approach was more tactful and won Estonian 'hearts and minds' ensuring cooperation and boosting recruitment.
                    
            As occupiers German soldiery were relatively favoured but any jubilation was later tempered by the revelation that atrocities were committed on Estonian soil against Jews, Roma and Russian POWs by Hitler's specialist executioners: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust_in_Estonia">  the Einsatzgruppen.</a>
