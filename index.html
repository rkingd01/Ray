            <p>This site is dedicated to the memory of my father Albert Georgijev born (1924) to Vassili and Alide Georgijev in Ingria, a region north and west of St Petersburg. A region with a strong association with the bordering countries of Finland and Estonia.  </p>
            <p>Dad's youngest memories in Niitskovitsa village seemed fond memories. They included helping his father with farming duties, the constant 'clackety-clack' of his mother's sewing machine, attending a Finnish school with Salme and generally being part of a busy household which became even busier on Sundays with visitors from church. </p>
            <p> Life suddenly changed when  Stalin's repressions took hold. Initially, the family had to face a period of vilification as part of a programme of state  propaganda.  </p> <p>   In order to agitate the poorest Russians, often illiterate, 
           <a href="https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2019/04/shsconf_modscapes2018_10003.pdf"> a national poster campaign conveying the evil </a>  of 'Kulaks' appeared in public places. </p>

          <p>
          In their turn the Georgijev family were stripped of the property they owned. A peaceful farming life came to an abrupt end.
            </p>
         
                        
          <p>As a child this life-changing event was difficult for my father (Albert hereafter) to comprehend. However, nothing could prepare him, his four sisters and parents for the unyielding programme of hatred that followed.

      Madis was a successful farmer in Markuse who provided regular employment and sold produce locally in Gatchina and St Petersburg. Unsurprisingly, marked as a Kulak all he owned was expropriated to the State. He and Maarja  were ordered to be deported to Kazakstan. </p>
    
      <p>
      Inexplicably, Madis and Maarja were not exiled to the East; when local agents came to collect them they could not be located in woodland and so missed the designated transport.   </p>
      <p>They were rehoused in nearby Volosova with the strict proviso that they should not make contact with family members. A sanction duly ignored as  Madis and Maarja made clandestine visits to their children and grand-children in the locality.

She was the proud owner of a sewing machine which she used throughout her life to provide a service of tailoring and repairing cloth.

          <p>
          After years of building up his farm Vassili lost his fields and livestock to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivization"> State 'Collective'. </a> He was put to work as a labourer on what had been his own land, permitted a single cow (photo), and paid in grain which he had to take to the mill to be ground to flour. 
          </p>
          <p>Vassili went through a period of deep despair and soon switched from farm hand to delivering goods by a horse-drawn cart.</p>

        Public access allowed inebriated intruders into the living quarters of the family compromising the safety of Alide and her daughters. </p>


        <p> Predictably an attempt was soon made to snatch the sewing machine but Alide and her children obstructed all efforts to remove it. The importance of the sewing machine cannot be over-stressed: Alide being a skilled seamstress repaired the clothing of her family and friends. </p>
        <p>After the upsetting skirmish in the home the authorities allowed the family to move to the empty house in Markuse. In the relative peace that followed sisters Lonni and Manni were born.

      <p>The 'removal' of Ingrians of Finnish-Estonian descent reached genocidal levels when Stalin gained further powers in 1938. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge">Unobstructed, Stalin's enforcers the NKVD </a> further purged the country of perceived 'enemies of the state'. From 1938 Non-Russian culture was targeted directly: In Ingria the use of Finnish was banned in schools. Instruction had to be delivered in Russian only. The formal education of Albert and Salme effectively ended. </p>

     
      <p>    At this time yields from the Collectives dropped so low that Russia had to import grain from the USA. In an attempt to resolve this system failure the State decided to rely less on manual labour, more on mechanisation. Fields needed to be extended with all obstacles removed including complete settlements.

              The Markuse family home was deemed to be an obstruction. The Georgijev family of eight were duly evicted and the home demolished leaving them homeless. They slept in a barn until a family of Finnish stock took them in. Floor space here was so limited that the adults had to sleep in the hall and landing.</p>
              <p>  Thankfully, the Georgijevs found a larger home before the Winter of 1938 and in Spring 1941 moved 30km north to Vitino near a Russian Air Force base. 
              Vitino was situated near the main east to west road. The air-base was targeted by the Luftwaffe but undeterred Meeta and Albert found work here and amongst many abandoned properties the Georgijevs had a choice of accommodation.</p>

      <p>Vitino though was unsafe. Alternatives presented a dilemma. To the east was Leningrad (50km).  To the west was Estonia but fierce fighting on a shifting front blocked the way. When a friend from Leningrad brought news of horrific conditions the family retreated back into the forest hoping the fighting further west would pass them by and leave the road clear to Narva. </p><!-- <div class="boxImage boxImage11"> -->

Silhouetted and silent, figures stood still atop the adjacent embankment. Anxious about Russian recrimination they were relieved that the unit was German with a contingent of Estonians.

    <h2>The Road to Narva</h2>

      <p>By mid-March 1942 most of the Vitino area was occupied by German units. In an eerie setting many homes and shops across the area were left empty. Standing aloft was a Romanov-type manor and here the dispossessed family stayed until a travel permit to the west was secured. </p>
      
      <p>
        Early on the morning of the 22nd March 1942 Albert and Vassili readied the horse and wagon for the trip to Narva.
        They spent four days and three nights on the road. When night fell they rested on the roadside. 
        Given her piety Alide prayed daily for the safety of her children.

    <h2>The Death of Alide</h2>
        <p>The Georgijev family reached the Estonian border town of Narva on the 25th March 1942.  Vassili and Alide had managed to get the children to safety. Thoroughly exhausted they were quarantined, bathed and fed.</p> 

       
        <p>With rest and nutrition all  recovered from the ordeal of the journey, except for Alide. </p>
        <p>Relieved of the strain Alide collapsed, extremely weakened. She died days later. Cause of death: typhus fever. Alide had made the ultimate sacrifice in order to safeguard her children.</p>
        <p>The seeds of hate were sewn into the heart of Albert and siblings regarding Stalin. Moreover, countries bordering the Russian State remain fearful of a malcontent world power led by a maleficent Putin.</p>
