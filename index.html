    <h1>Albert Georgijev</h1>

    <p>
    My father's many friends called him 'Fred'. They may have guessed that this came from 'Alfred' but they had no idea that he had been born 'Albert' in rural Ingria, West of Leningrad. 
    They wouldn't have known that he'd seen his parents humiliated and stripped of their farm.
     They wouldn't have known that his family were evicted and made homeless so that Collective fields could be enlarged.</p>

      <p> Amidst a period of fighting his family lived 'rough' in a forest until they were ejected by a Russian patrol. After aborting their travel to Leningrad they defiantly returned to the forest only to be discovered by a German patrol which in contrast provided assistance.</p>
      
      <p>For two days the family made their way out of Stalin's Russia to safety in Estonia. At Narva (Ee) he witnessed his mother collapsing with the strain of getting her seven children out of Stalin's reach, too weak to recover. 
     
        Vengeful, as soon as he was able Albert, Russian by birth, sought to join the Estonian division of the Waffen SS.</p>

<p>The following images depict my father at various stages in his life. Albert Georgiev was born in 1924 in Niitsforgika, Ingria Russia and died in cardiff UK at 74. He was the only boy who survived childhood in a family of nine. His father farmed, his mother sewed. In the week Albert attended school with sister (BBBB). On Sundays all attended church and entertained visitors at home. A life with regularity and security. Until Stalin's reforms hit the family. The farm was confiscated, all land lost, all animals taken. The home had to be shared with a Collectives shop until the family moved to a home vacated by Alide's parents.
