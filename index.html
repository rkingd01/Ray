    <h1>Albert Georgijev</h1>

    <p>
    My father's many friends knew Dad simply as 'Fred'. They had no idea that he originated from Ingria, Russia and was christened 'Albert'. Or that his parents were stripped of their farm, evicted, and left homeless
  by Stalin's Russia.  In trying to escape he and his six siblings lost their mother.  </p>

<p>The following images depict my father at various stages in his life. Albert Georgiev was born in 1924 in Niitsforgika, Ingria Russia and died in cardiff UK at 74. He was the only boy who survived childhood in a family of nine. His father farmed, his mother sewed. In the week Albert attended school with sister (BBBB). On Sundays all attended church and entertained visitors at home. A life with regularity and security. Until Stalin's reforms hit the family. The farm was confiscated, all land lost, all animals taken. The home had to be shared with a Collectives shop until the family moved to a home vacated by Alide's parents.
