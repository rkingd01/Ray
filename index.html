    <h1>Albert Georgijev</h1>

    <p>
    My father's friends knew Dad as 'Fred', a shortened  'Alfred'. They wouldn't have known that he had been born  'Albert' in rural Ingria, West of Leningrad. Or that his parents were stripped of their farm, evicted and made homeless by a malevolent force. 
   They would certainly not be aware of his family living 'rough' in woodland to avoid shelling until ejected by Russian troops. With the road to Leningrad blocked they returned to the wooded shelter only to be confronted by a German patrol whose leader provided assistance in escaping Stalin. Unfortunately, the journey to safety proved tragic.  </p>

<p>The following images depict my father at various stages in his life. Albert Georgiev was born in 1924 in Niitsforgika, Ingria Russia and died in cardiff UK at 74. He was the only boy who survived childhood in a family of nine. His father farmed, his mother sewed. In the week Albert attended school with sister (BBBB). On Sundays all attended church and entertained visitors at home. A life with regularity and security. Until Stalin's reforms hit the family. The farm was confiscated, all land lost, all animals taken. The home had to be shared with a Collectives shop until the family moved to a home vacated by Alide's parents.
