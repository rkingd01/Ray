    <h1>Albert Georgijev</h1>

    <p>
      My father's co-workers and friends called my dad Fred. They didn't know that his real name was Alfred and that he had been born Albert.
    </p>
    <p>Neither did they know that as a boy... </p>
      <p>...he'd lived in rural Ingria, West of Leningrad and seen his parents stripped of their farm;</p>
      <p>...his family were made homeless to make a Collective field larger;</p>
      <p>...he and his family lived 'rough' in a forest until they were threatened by a Russian patrol;</p>
      <p>...he and the family were discovered hiding in another forest by a German patrol which provided assistance;</p>
      <p>...he and his family walked for two days to get out of Stalin's Russia to safety in Estonia.</p>
      <p>...he witnessed his mother collapsing and  unable to recover from the strain of getting her children out of Stalin's reach. As soon as he was able he joined the German army that had rid Estonia of their Russian occupiers.</p>
      <p>...</p>

<p>The following images depict my father at various stages in his life. Albert Georgiev was born in 1924 in Niitsforgika, Ingria Russia and died in cardiff UK at 74. He was the only boy who survived childhood in a family of nine. His father farmed, his mother sewed. In the week Albert attended school with sister (BBBB). On Sundays all attended church and entertained visitors at home. A life with regularity and security. Until Stalin's reforms hit the family. The farm was confiscated, all land lost, all animals taken. The home had to be shared with a Collectives shop until the family moved to a home vacated by Alide's parents.
